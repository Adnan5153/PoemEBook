    <string name="moonlit">In the heart of night under moon\'s gentle gaze, Whispers of mischief in the forest\'s embrace. Shadows dance lightly on a silvery floor, Secrets and stories of the night\'s ancient lore. Tiny feet patter in a joyful parade, Under the watch of the ever-watchful glade. Moonlit beams catch on wings, a fleeting kiss, In this moment, time holds only bliss. Creatures of night, in their playful quest, Find in each shadow a place to jest. The forest alive with laughter and glee, A magical world only they can see. In the gleam of the moon, mysteries unfold, Tales of the night, bravely bold. Mischief and wonder in every glance, In the woodland\'s embrace, they dance. So when the moon ascends the sky\'s grand stage, And night cloaks the world in its wise, old age, Remember the magic that thrives unseen, In the heart of the forest, where the night has been.</string>
